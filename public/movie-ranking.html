<h1>Top 3 movies/series by Luis</h1>
<h2> The best cinema in my opinion</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Not only is this the best compilation of movies thus far, but it is a story of a lifetime,<br /> 
   engaging, and you can never get tired of watching this.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>The magic was felt in the movie theatre when I was a kid. This series was and is the most successful of all time,<br /> 
   and among my personal favorites.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>This is self-explanatory, this series is mind bending, gut wrentching, and action filled. It really is an out of this world experience.</p>
